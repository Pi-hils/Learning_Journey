JS is a lightweight= not much memory 
cross platform = can be used on multiple platform
object-oriented program

Was traditionally used only in browser
Node allows JS on the server now

HTML, CSS AND JS all work together

## 5 Datatypes
1. Number: Floating point SVGAnimatedNumberList, for decimals and integers
2. String: Sequence of characters, used for Text
3. Boolean: Logical data type- true/false
4. Undefined: Data type of a variable that doesn't have a value
5. Null: Also means 'non-existent'

Javascript has dynamic typing: data types are automaticall assigned to variables

<u>Rules</u>
- Variables cannot start with numbers/sy,bols except $/underscore e.g CANNOT HAVE:
 var3years =3; ERROR
- Use camelCase

How To Comment Out
use (the two // ) //Variables and data type


Modules
To keep pieces of code related to each other together inside of separate indep and org units. 
Will have var that are private - accssible inside module
so other code cannot overide our data and will be safe. Some too will- encapsulation

We use module patterns to create module

Data Encapsulation
Allows to hide implementation details of certain module from outside scope 
so we only expose public interface, also called API
