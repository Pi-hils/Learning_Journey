_My weekly journal to track my learning and development during my time at Makers Academy_

Kickoff of the week 

Week 1, we will be introduced to bst practices, learnning a new language <u>Ruby</u> and by using our knowledge from ruby to research topics and concepts essential to test drive a code, e.g Strings, Arrays, etc

3. Follow a Driver-Navigator style of programming each day with a new person in my cohort.
4. Markdown language on github.
4. Read up on what Object Oriented Programming is.
5. What is encapsulation?
6. Attend my first debugging workshop.
7. Read more on encapsulation.
8. Practice setting up repositories on github.
9. Go over Arrays in Ruby.


## What I've learned
_Thins I've learnt or improved, and links to examples._

- **Concrete things** (e.g written a test or set up rspec).
    -Constructing a class.
    

- **Concepts** 
    - Test driving and using a process.
    - Pairing with multiple people and building rapport to complete tasks.

- **Processes** (i.e debugging or problem breakdown -> TDD)
