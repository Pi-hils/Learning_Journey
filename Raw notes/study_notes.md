Not just build an app with CRUD (too basic), start using fundamenntal principles of what makes code good - use TDD, OOP, BDD, Mocking, Encapsulation and everything else you have learned thus far.

- Write a test first before writing a code
- Use [better Specs](https://www.betterspecs.org/)

1. Be able to understand jargons e.g encapsulation, duck typing etc
