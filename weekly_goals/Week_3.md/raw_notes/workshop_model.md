# Process Modelling, applied to HTTP request/response cycle.

What is a process?
1. Steps to take to achieve something
2. Something with a start and an end
3. A series of tasks
4. Series of steps
5.  transition through different phases
6. Executed in a precise order
7. Methods to achieve something
8. Finishing with an output

What is a model?
1. Representation of something
2. Some visual representation of a process.
3. Simplified version of something
4. Representation that communicates the main elements relevant to the audience.

_Diagraming saves a lot more time to convey an information than a code._

Learning Objectives
- Define Process modelling as a tool 
- Use process modelling to further understand HTTP requests and responses.

Why model a process?
- It's easier to iterate on a process model tahn the code taht enacts the process
- It's great way to communicate and discuss a process with another person
Much easier to add details to a process model than to add it to code.
