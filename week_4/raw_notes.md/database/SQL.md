How do databases work
[Database](https://maggieappleton.com/databases).
- Databases are the storage shelves of the digital world. They are where we store all our masses of infomration.

**Interacting with databases**_(fundamental): 
**C.R.U.D** - Create, Read, Update, Delete

- Every database has a **D.B.M.S (DataBase, Management, System)** which structures how we **organise** and **interact** with all our stored _data_. They come in 2 ways.

1. **Relational**: Organizes data in tables made up of **Columns** & **rows**.

  - Columns are categories & each row inside them holds a data entry.
  - Tables are referred to as _relations_;  columns are referred to as _attributes_; and each rows as a _record_.
  - They're highly structures and have **Strict** (great for managing complex datasets) data types.
  - The pattern to which you manage all your rows, columns and tables is known as a **_Schemma_**
  - Provides accurate data as it's stored only once unless designed not to.
  - Dynamic and flexible - tables and many data can be merged together to get results.
  
  _This is where SQL comes in. We interact with the columns and rows using SQL (Structure Query Language)._ Some commands includes: _join, insert, delete, select_.

2. **Non-Relational**: _Also known as "NoSQL" (SQL is not effective here)._
    - Includes : Graph, Key Value, Document, Column Family
    - There are more flexible systems with less strictness around data types.
    - Efficient for starting a database quickly as there is no strict schema (tables, columns & rows) before adding your data.
    - Excellent for deploying data across **decentralized Distributed** networks.

Among the top 5 DBMS services, 4 are Relational and 1 is non-relational.

_Key word_

*Decentralised Distributed newtwrok* : is when data can be stored across many computers that all have to coordinate with one another.
