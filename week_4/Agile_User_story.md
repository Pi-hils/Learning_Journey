# Agile Modeling

User stories are one of the primary development artifacts that Scrun and Extreme Programmers(XP) project team utilises. 

A user story is a high-level definition of a requirement which contains enough information for a developer to produce a general estimatation of the effort to be implemented.

## STEPS
1. INTRO TO USER STORIES
 A user story paves way to have a conversation/ just-in-time analysis with the customer (in XP, project stakeholder are called customers). 

 2. Initial User Stories(Informal)
 User stories shoukd be kept at a minimum.

 Essentials before writing a User story.
  1. **Stakeholders write their user stories**. A developer should not write a user story but the project stakeholder.

  2. **Use the simplest tool**. User stories should be written on an index card- an inclusive modeling technique.

  3. **Remember non-functional requirements**. Stories can be used to describe a broad range of requirements types.

  4. **Indicate the estimate size**.
