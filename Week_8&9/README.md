## What I found challenging
- Rails comes with a school of folders and some of the folders didn't seem to have much use so it was hard to understand why they were there.
- Start of every new framework is challenging
- Keeping up with the numeroud files that comes with rails
- Interpolating the ruby code using some HTML also.

## What I enjoyed
- Learning a completely new framework in 2 days
- Working as part of a team
- Getting more exposure with databases
- Seeing results in a short period of time due to rails
- UI area
