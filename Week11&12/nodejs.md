What is it?
Node is not a langugae but runtime that allows javascript to run on a server. A way for devs to write a full stack on a server

## How it works

Visit a url on internet pointing to the server `http//localhost:...`

When request is received, we can use node to handle the request and read a file of server's file system

and respond to the client so they can view the html in broswer

#### Step two
<u>Installation</u>
check if node is installed by running `node -v.
If it is not installed, install.

#### Step Three
<u>Hello World</u>
> In terminnal, type `node ` - this allows us to go on REPL mode and type javascript there like a console
> To exit, press ^C again or ^D or type .exit
