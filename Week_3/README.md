_My weekly journal to track my learning and development during my time at Makers Academy._

Kickoff of the week

## Week 3 Goals
- Build a simple web app
- Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- Explain the MVC pattern

---
## Personal Goals
1. [GET & POST](https://github.com/Pi-hils/Battle_Challenge).
2. Understanding Request annd response cycle

## What I found challenging
- Understanding the use of global variable
- How to link my feature test with my controller and when it was required, e.g in the [rps-challenge](https://github.com/Pi-hils/rps-challenge-1), I found it hard to get my app.rb to connect with my results page.


## What I found enjoyable
- Learning about the web- it's a new and vital area.
- Learning how to debug the web.
- Customising pages to make it my own.
- Working and learning from people within my cohort.
